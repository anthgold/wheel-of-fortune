# Project: Wheel of Fortune

#### _A website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol to create a word puzzle to solve, version 1.2, current as of 5.2.2016._

#### By _**Anthony C. Gold**_

## Description

This is the solo coding exercise from the Epicodus Java course, week 1. It creates a website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol to create a word puzzle to solve. The resulting word puzzle is on a new page that does not show the original string so that another person can try and guess it.
